            <h3>Section 1: What is a portfolio and why do I need one?</h3>
            <p>A portfolio is a curated collection of your work that showcases your skills, experiences, and
                accomplishments. It serves as a visual and tangible representation of your abilities, allowing potential
                employers to see the quality and scope of your work. There are many portfolio platforms available,
                including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">Behance</a> - A platform for showcasing and
                    discovering creative work, popular among designers and artists.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> - A community for designers to
                    share their work, find inspiration, and connect with potential clients or employers.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - A platform for developers to showcase
                    their coding projects, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source software.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a> - A website builder that allows you to create
                    a personalized portfolio website with customizable templates and features.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although there are many platforms available, you can also create a simple portfolio using Google Sites or
                a PDF document. The key is to choose a format that best showcases your work and is easy for potential
                employers to access.

            <h3>Section 2: What should I include in my portfolio?</h3>
            <p>Your portfolio should include a selection of your best work that demonstrates your skills and experiences
                relevant to your career goals, while also tailoring it to the career you want. Some key components to
                consider are:</p>

                <li><b>Work Samples:</b> A selection of projects, assignments, or case studies that highlight your
                    skills and accomplishments. Include descriptions of each project, your role, the tools and
                    technologies used, and the outcomes achieved.</li>
                <li><b>Skills and Competencies:</b> A list of relevant skills, both technical and soft, that you
                    possess.</li>

                    and work ethic.</li>

            <h2>Portfolio FAQ</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>How long should my portfolio be?</b> There's no set length for a portfolio, but aim to include
                    5-10 high-quality work samples that effectively showcase your skills and experiences.</li>
                <li><b>Should I create different portfolios for different job applications?</b> It's a good idea to
                    tailor your portfolio to the specific job or industry you're applying to by highlighting relevant
                    work samples and skills, but you don't necessarily need to create a new portfolio for every
                    opportunity.</li>
                <li><b>Can I include personal projects in my portfolio?</b> Absolutely! Personal projects can
                    demonstrate your passion, creativity, and initiative. Just ensure they are relevant to your career
                    goals.</li>
                <li><b>How do I share my portfolio with potential employers?</b> You can share a link to your online
                    portfolio in your resume, cover letter, or email signature. If you have a PDF portfolio, you can
                    attach it to job applications or email it directly to employers.</li>
